# Agriculture-Supply-Chain-Management :link:	

#### This repository contains code for an Agricultural Suppy Chain Management DApp using _*Solidity*_ and _*Truffle*_. The _*Smart Contracts*_ are deployed on remote nodes using _*Truffle*_ and interactions are made using _*Ethereum*_ and _*web3.js*_ library. 

## Traditional farming-transport challenges :shopping: :package:	
 * Outdated traditional delivery practices
 * Adulterated food quality
 * Price inflation due to middle-men intervention
 * Delayed Payments/ unpaid contracts and lack of trust between both parties


## Why agri-chain? :ear_of_rice:	:cherries:	
* It provides trancparency between the farmers and customers
* Keeps a record of transactions
* Solves the problems of price-inflation/ food-adulteration that occurs due to involvement of middle-men
* The payment is automated and is kept stored under the contract address and is released only after a confirmation from the customer

## Tech Stacks	:computer: 
* Solidity 
* [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/)
* [Ganache (for local deployment)](https://trufflesuite.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

```

#### ganache local testing
Open ganache 
<br>
Create new workspace and name it
<br>
Add location of *truffle-config.js* file from project
<br>
Save workspace

## All set. Woohooo! :rocket:
